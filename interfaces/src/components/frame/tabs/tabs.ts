 * contents that works for everyone. The roles, which tab is selected and
 * which panels are hidden are written by `<lt-tabs>`. Had they been here, the
 * markup without JavaScript would have said "tab" about a link that does not
 * behave like one, and hidden the panels.
 *
 * The first tab is selected when the page loads. Another one comes from the
 * address, such as `#case-attachments`, or from `selected` and `select()` on
 * `<lt-tabs>`.
 *
 * A React app uses `lt.tabs()` from `@lo-tek/interfaces/react`, which gives
 * the whole state, so React hydrates without mismatches.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const tabs = lt.tabs({ id: "case", keys: ["application", "attachments"], label: "Parts of the case" })

 * React hydrated, that gave one mismatch per element. Here everything is
 * there from the start, so the web component has nothing to write.
 *
 * The links get their id from the server, and each panel points to its link,
 * as the APG does. An id the server writes is stable; it is an id the web
 * component creates itself that makes an update replace the element.
 *
