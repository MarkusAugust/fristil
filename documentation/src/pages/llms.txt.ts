 * `llms.txt`: the entry point for an agent that only has web access.

 * Following the format on llmstxt.org: one heading, one summary, and then
 * links with one line each. It is an index, not a rulebook. The rules in full
 * are in `/agent/<name>.md`, one complete file per environment.
 *
 * The four rules are still here, in short form. An agent that fetches only
 * this file and follows not a single link should still not have to guess at
 * what costs the most.
 *
 * Everything apart from the four rules is read from the content: the rulebooks
 * from the folder they are in, and the page list from the collection Starlight
 * builds. Then none of them can drift from what actually exists.

const RULES = `Four mistakes account for almost everything that goes wrong. They apply in every environment:

1. The stylesheet must be loaded. If it is missing, the components look
   unstyled, and the answer is to load it, never to write your own CSS to make
   them look right.
2. Only the classes and elements that exist, exist. \`lt-modal\`,
   \`lt-datepicker\` and \`data-variant="outline"\` belong to other design
   systems. The full list is in every rulebook.
3. No hard-coded colours or pixels. \`var(--lt-color-…)\` and
   \`var(--lt-spacing-…)\`.
4. Web components are registered once with \`defineLt*()\`, and a boolean
   attribute is true as long as it is there: \`invalid="false"\` makes the
   field invalid. The attribute has to be removed, not set to \`false\`.

Check the markup when you are done, and fix what it reports:

    npx @lo-tek/interfaces check <file>
    npx @lo-tek/interfaces check http://localhost:8080/page

It knows every class, every element, every attribute and every valid value,
writes \`file:line:column: error: message\`, or \`warning:\`, and exits with an error code when it finds something.
With an address it checks the page as the server sends it, and also requires
that every \`for\` and \`aria-describedby\` points at an id that exists, and
that every field has a label. You are done when both answer "The markup
matches LO-TEK". Everything about the commands: ${BASE}/command-line/`
