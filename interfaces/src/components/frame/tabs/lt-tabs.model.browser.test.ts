/**
 * Every sequence of server updates and user actions on a tab list, to a
 * fixed depth, with the screen reader's view checked after each step.
 *
 * The scenario tests next to this one each follow one path: a click, a
 * patch, then a look. This one does not choose: the server can send any of
 * the versions below, by any of the ways an update arrives, and the user can
 * click, press the keys the component promises, and move into the panel, in
 * any order. After every step the page as the browser rendered it goes to the
 * core, which computes the accessibility tree from the specifications, and
 * the invariants are checked on that tree, on the wiring the component
 * promises, on the focus and on the address.
 *
 * Which tab must be selected after a step is computed from what the page
 * promises, from the page as it stood before the step: the user's selection
 * survives a morph, the server's word decides when the user has chosen
 * nothing or under `server-controlled`, and on load the server's
 * `aria-selected` comes before the address. The address is read from the
 * page, not modelled: the engines refuse to write it after so many calls in
 * ten seconds (see `BUDGET`), and the component then reads the address as it
 * is.
 *
 * The page is the recipe from the component page, the component is the real
 * one, and so are Datastar and idiomorph. The core's tree is compared with
 * what Chromium and Firefox give through AT-SPI in
 * `check-accessibility-tree.ts`.
