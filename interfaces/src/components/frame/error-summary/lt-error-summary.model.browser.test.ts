/**
 * Every sequence of server updates and user actions, to a fixed depth, with
 * the screen reader's view checked after each step.
 *
 * The scenario tests next to this one were each written by someone who
 * thought of the case. This one does not choose: the server can send any of
 * the versions below, by any of the three ways an update arrives, and the
 * user can move into a field, in any order. After every step the page as the
 * browser rendered it goes to the core, which computes the accessibility
 * tree from the specifications, and the invariants are checked on that tree,
 * not on attributes.
 *
 * Nothing here is a second implementation: the page is the recipe from the
 * component page, the component is the real one, and so are Datastar and
 * idiomorph. The core's tree is compared with what Chromium and Firefox give
 * through AT-SPI on every contract step in `check-accessibility-tree.ts`.
