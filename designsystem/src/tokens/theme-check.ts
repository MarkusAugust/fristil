 * Checks a theme a consumer has written by hand.
 *
 * The generator keeps the promises by construction. When someone writes in
 * values of their choosing, keeping the promises is up to them, and then we
 * owe them an answer about which cell breaks. Without this, "you can override
 * anything" is a trap.
 *
 * All that matters is which `--lt-color-*` is in which block, and whether the
 * block is light or dark, read from `color-scheme` or the selector. A value
 * that cannot be computed is reported as exactly that instead of being
 * skipped, and missing values are filled from LO-TEK's default theme, so
 * someone who has overridden a single cell gets it checked against the rest
 * of the system.
 *
 * The check is the core, written in Rust, the same one `lotek check-theme`
 * uses.
