/**
 * The keyboard and the filtering in a field with a suggestion list.
 *
 * The server writes the field and the list. When the markup is made with
 * JavaScript, `lt.suggestion()` writes the roles, the ids and the wiring.
 * When it comes from a template without JavaScript, the template writes
 * `for` on the label and `id` on the field, or wraps the field in the label,
 * which HTML requires for the field to have a name without JavaScript. The
 * rest is enough: a `.lt-suggestion__list` with `<li>` and a
 * `[role="status"]`. The web component sets the roles, gives the list and the
 * options ids, connects the list to the field, and closes the list until the
 * user touches the field. Only what is missing, so what the server wrote
 * stays.
 *
 * The web component never writes an id on the field. Datastar and idiomorph
 * recognise a node by its id, and a field with an id the server did not send
 * is replaced on the next update, along with focus and what the user has
 * typed.
 *
 * The field always shows the option's text. If the server has written a
 * hidden `.lt-suggestion__value`, it receives the code from `data-value`, or
 * the text when the option has none. Without JavaScript the text is
 * submitted, and the server looks it up. The web component renders nothing.
 * It used to create the whole field itself, and then there was neither a
 * label nor an input before the script had run, and nothing was included in
 * the submission.
 *
 * What the web component does is what the browser does not: it filters the
 * options while the user types, moves the highlight with the arrow keys, and
 * keeps `aria-activedescendant` in sync so the screen reader announces the
 * option without focus leaving the field.
 *
 * If something else has already filtered, a server or a React component that
 * renders only the matches, `prefiltered` says so, and the web component
 * leaves the options alone.
 *
 * ```html
 * <lt-suggestion>
 *   <label class="lt-label" for="city">City</label>
 *   <input class="lt-input" id="city" role="combobox" aria-controls="city-list"
 *          aria-expanded="false" aria-autocomplete="list" autocomplete="off"
 *          aria-describedby="city-status">
 *   <ul class="lt-suggestion__list" id="city-list" role="listbox" hidden>
