//! The colour contract: what each role is, and what it promises.
//!
//! One colour layer, not two. A colour is a point in a matrix of **family**
//! (what it means) and **role** (what it does), and every family has the
//! same roles. That structure is what makes the families match.
//!
//! The hue comes from the consumer, the lightness from the role. That way
//! the contrast is guaranteed by construction rather than by a check
//! afterwards.
//!
//! The numbers are in `interfaces/src/tokens/color-contract.json`, not
//! here, so the TypeScript scripts and the core read the same ones. The core
//! does not carry the file: the host gives it with `load_contract_raw`, as it
//! gives the manifest. Three choices in the numbers that are not obvious:
//!
//! - `fill` is set by `content` having to be readable on top of it, not by
//!   the distance to the page. Chosen by the page alone, it becomes too light
//!   to carry text.
//! - Text and border have three steps each. Body text should not sit at the
//!   minimum requirement: set to `text` it became `#4a4d51` rather than
//!   `#1a1a1a`, and that is a real loss in readability even though the
//!   requirement held.
//! - `textStrong` has low chroma, since a strong text colour is nearly black
//!   or white whatever the hue.
//!
//! The lightness values were worked out against a sweep around the whole
//! colour wheel, at the highest chroma sRGB can show for each hue. If you
//! change one of the numbers, the promises are what tell you.
//!
//! `borderSubtle` has no promise on purpose: a decorative divider is not
//! needed to understand the page, and WCAG 1.4.11 does not apply to it. When
//! the border needs to mean something, `border` is the right one.
