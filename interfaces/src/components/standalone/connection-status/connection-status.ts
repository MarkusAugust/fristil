 * The attributes for the bar that says the connection is lost.

 * By definition the server cannot tell you it is unreachable. When it is
 * down, nothing comes from it to render. So the component creates all the
 * content itself, and `data-ignore-morph` stops a later patch from tearing
 * it away the moment the connection is back. The host is the live region,
 * `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`, so the region exists before the
 * bar and its text arrive.
 *
 * ```ts
 * <lt-connection-status {...lt.connectionStatus()} />
