/**
 * That no markup for the browser imports a package name.
 *
 * `import … from "@lo-tek/interfaces/field"` in a `<script type="module">`
 * does not resolve in a browser: without a build step or an import map the
 * package name does not exist, and the import fails silently. The code looks
 * right, and does not work when pasted.
 *
 * The rule already existed in `check-recipes.ts`, but it only reads the
 * component pages and picks the rule from the name of the tab. Two pages
 * outside that search therefore had the bug for several rounds: the Datastar
 * track in `frameworks.mdx` and the dialog in `patterns/confirmation.mdx`.
 * This check is simpler and covers everything: an `html` block is markup for
 * the browser whatever page it is on, and whatever the surrounding tab is
 * called.
 *
 * `ts`, `tsx`, `js` and `astro` are not checked. There is a build step there,
 * and then the package name is right.
 *
 * Run with: bun documentation/scripts/check-browser-import.ts
