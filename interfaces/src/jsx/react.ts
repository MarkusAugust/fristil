/**
 * Types for the LO-TEK web components in JSX.
 *
 * Without them TypeScript does not know `<lt-field>` at all, and says
 * "Property 'lt-field' does not exist on type JSX.IntrinsicElements". And the
 * attributes are hyphenated strings without completion, so `described-by`
 * and `server-controlled` are exactly where a typo is easy to make and hard
 * to spot.
 *
 * Import once in the project, preferably from a `.d.ts` file so it does not
 * end up in the bundle:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // src/lotek.d.ts
 * import "@lo-tek/interfaces/react-jsx"
 * ```
 *
 * Astro does not need this: there `<lt-field>` is plain HTML, and no type
 * check looks at the element name.

/**
 * Boolean attributes on web components.
 *
 * The type is `true | undefined`, not `boolean` and not `""`, and that is
 * deliberate. React treats web components differently between versions, and
 * only one pattern is right in both:
 *
 *     React 18 sets attributes          React 19 sets properties
 *     open=""          works             never open
 *     open={true}      works             works
 *     open={false}     ALWAYS open       works
 *     open={undefined} works             works
 *
 * React 18 stringifies to `open="false"`. The attribute then exists, and is
 * therefore true. React 19 sets the property to `""`, which is falsy, and
 * the setter in the component removes the attribute again.
 *
 * That is why the builder functions send `true` for a boolean attribute on a
 * host, not the empty string. `data-*` is different: React passes those on
 * as attributes in both versions, and there `""` is the canonical form.
 *
 * When you write it by hand, write `open={isOpen || undefined}`. The type
 * here makes the two other variants compile errors instead of something you
 * have to remember.
