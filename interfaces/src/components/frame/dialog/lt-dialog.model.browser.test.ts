/**
 * Every sequence of server updates and user actions on a dialog the server
 * opens, to a fixed depth, with the screen reader's view checked after each
 * step.
 *
 * The scenario tests in `dialog.browser.test.ts` each follow one path: a
 * patch, a close, then a look. This one does not choose: the server can send
 * any of the versions below, by any of the ways an update arrives, and the
 * user can open the dialog from a button on the page, close it with Escape
 * or a button in the form, move within it, and the app can write the
 * property, in any order. After every step the page as the browser rendered
 * it goes to the core, which computes the accessibility tree from the
 * specifications, and the invariants are checked on that tree, on the top
 * layer, on the name, on the focus, on the events and on the ids.
 *
 * Whether the dialog must be modal after a step is computed from what the
 * page promises, from the page as it stood before the step: `open` on the
 * host is the server's word, so a morph that sends it opens the dialog again
 * also after the user closed it, and one without it closes the dialog; the
 * user's close takes `open` from the host. Where the focus must go when the
 * dialog closes is the browser's memory, not the page's, so the element that
 * had focus when the dialog opened is part of the context.
 *
 * The page is the Datastar recipe from the component page, with the button
 * that opens the dialog in the "Plain HTML" recipe next to it, standing in
 * for the button that asks the server to open it. The component is the real
 * one, and so are Datastar and idiomorph.
