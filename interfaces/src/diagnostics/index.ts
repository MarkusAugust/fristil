/**
 * Checks markup against LO-TEK, outside the browser.
 *
 * `diagnoseMarkup(html)` is the same check the editor extensions run while
 * you type, and that `lotek check` runs on the command line. It is here
 * because markup produced without JavaScript, in a Go template, a Kotlin
 * string or a Razor view, has no compiler looking at the attributes. A test
 * in the app can then run it over the HTML the server actually sends:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { diagnosePage } from "@lo-tek/interfaces/diagnostics"
 *
 * expect(diagnosePage(html)).toEqual([])
 * ```
 *
 * The check is the core, written in Rust and built to WebAssembly (see
 * `core.ts`). The module ships with the package, and is loaded the first
 * time one of the functions is called, in Node, Bun and Deno. In the
 * browser, or where the module is bundled some other way, `loadCore` loads
 * it.
