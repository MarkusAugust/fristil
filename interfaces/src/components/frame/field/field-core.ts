   * once, call `createFieldId()` yourself.
   *
   * It used to be optional, and the function created one when it was
   * missing. That id is random, so two runs give two different ones, and if
   * the same field is rendered on a server and then in the browser, `for`
   * and `aria-describedby` point to something other than what is there.
   * React reports a mismatch on hydration, and the warning itself says the
   * mismatch is not repaired.
   *
   * The type requires it, and that is not enough on its own: a consumer
   * without TypeScript sees no type. If the id is left out anyway, the
   * function creates one and says so in the console. The field then works,
   * and the developer learns why the id should be given anyway. Without the
   * fallback they got `for=""`, `aria-describedby="undefined-help"` and no
   * wiring at all, which is worse than the unstable id the requirement was
   * meant to remove.
