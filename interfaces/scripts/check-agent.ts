/**
 * That the rulebooks in `agent/` match the package.
 *
 * An agent instruction with a mistake in it is worse than no instruction: it
 * looks authoritative, and the agent writes the mistake into the consumer's
 * app without asking. Every claim in every rulebook is therefore checked
 * against what the package actually ships, in the same way
 * `check-recipes.ts` does for the component pages.
 *
 *   - the files on disk are the ones the generator would write now;
 *   - every class and every element the package has is in every rulebook;
 *   - every markup block passes LO-TEK's own check without findings;
 *   - every `@lo-tek/interfaces/…` exists in `exports`;
 *   - every `defineLtX` matches an element that exists;
 *   - every `lt.x()` is a builder function that exists;
 *   - every token name is in `tokens.css`;
 *   - only the React rulebook shows the React entry, `useEffect` and `createRoot`;
 *   - no markup for the browser imports a package name.
 *
 * Run with: bun scripts/check-agent.ts, or as part of `bun run build`.
