/**
 * The accessibility contracts, checked against what AT-SPI gives a screen
 * reader, in Chromium and Firefox.
 *
 * A screen reader is a machine: what it says is a function of the platform's
 * accessibility tree and the events the browser sends through the platform
 * API. Those two are what this reads, the way Orca does, through AT-SPI on
 * Linux, with the expected values from the contracts in
 * `accessibility/contracts.ts`. No speech and no clock: every step waits for
 * the event it expects, with a deadline that fails with the step's name.
 *
 * Each contract runs on the recipe from its component page, the "Plain HTML"
 * tab, with the CDN addresses rewritten to this package: what a reader
 * pastes is what is checked. Each run checks the contract on the recipe as it
 * is, where every step must pass, and on every mutation the contract lists,
 * where the run must fail at exactly the step the mutation names. The
 * mutation tests are part of every run.
 *
 * On Linux it runs here, inside an accessibility session
 * (`accessibility/session.sh`). Elsewhere it runs itself in the Playwright
 * image CI uses, with podman or docker.
 *
 * Run with: bun run build, then bun interfaces/scripts/check-accessibility-tree.ts
