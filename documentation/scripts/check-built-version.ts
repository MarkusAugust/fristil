 * That the version was actually inserted into the built output.

 * The addresses in the examples are written as `@lo-tek/interfaces@VERSION`
 * in the source, and `remark-version.mjs` replaces the placeholder when the
 * page is built. Two guards watched the source, and none watched the output.
 *
 * It is not a theoretical gap. `astro.config.mjs` itself says that
 * `markdown.remarkPlugins` is marked as deprecated, and that the MDX path is
 * the only thing keeping it alive. If the plugin stops running, every address
 * goes out with the word VERSION in it, the "Plain HTML" and Datastar track is
 * dead for the reader, and `bun run check` is green all the way.
 *
 * Run with: bun documentation/scripts/check-built-version.ts
 * Requires `documentation/dist` to be built.
