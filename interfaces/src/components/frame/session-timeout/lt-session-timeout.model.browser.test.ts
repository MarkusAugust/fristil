/**
 * Every sequence of server updates, user actions and seconds passing on the
 * session warning, to a fixed depth, with the screen reader's view, the
 * events and the focus checked after each step.
 *
 * The scenario tests in `lt-session-timeout.browser.test.ts` each follow one
 * path: so many seconds, a key press, a look. This one does not choose: the
 * server can send any of the versions below, by any of the ways an update
 * arrives, the user can be active, answer the warning or press Escape, the
 * app can call `extend()` or `reset()`, and the clock can move to the
 * moments the promises name, in any order.
 *
 * What must happen is computed by a clock of the test's own, from what the
 * page and the doc comments promise: the warning opens at `warn-at` seconds
 * without activity and the session expires at `expires-at`; activity counts
 * only while the warning is closed and the session is not over; the warning
 * is announced as it opens and at 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 and 10 seconds
 * left; `session-activity` comes at the start of an interval and at its end
 * when the user did something since, never while the warning shows; after
 * `session-expired` and `session-logout` nothing happens until `extend()` or
 * `reset()`. The component's own clock is not read: the test's clock says
 * what the component's must have done.
 *
 * The page is the "Plain HTML" recipe from the component page, in a region
 * the server updates, next to a field the user is filling in and a panel
 * that scrolls. The component is the real one, and so are Datastar and
 * idiomorph. Time is a fake clock (`setInterval` and `Date`), installed
 * before every replay, so a path of 1800 seconds takes milliseconds.
