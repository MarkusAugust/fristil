/**
 * Every sequence of server updates and user actions on a field, to a fixed
 * depth, with the screen reader's view checked after each step.
 *
 * The scenario tests in `lt-field.browser.test.ts` each follow one path:
 * a patch, then a look. This one does not choose: the server can send any of
 * the versions below, by any of the ways an update arrives, and the user can
 * move into the field, type and leave it, in any order. After every step the
 * page as the browser rendered it goes to the core, which computes the
 * accessibility tree from the specifications, and the invariants are checked
 * on that tree and on the wiring the component promises.
 *
 * The page is the recipe from the component page, the component is the real
 * one, and so are Datastar and idiomorph. The core's tree is compared with
 * what Chromium and Firefox give through AT-SPI in
 * `check-accessibility-tree.ts`.
