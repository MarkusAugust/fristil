/**
 * Takes the user from an error in the summary to the field that failed.
 *
 * The server writes the content: the heading and the list of links. When the
 * markup is written with JavaScript, `lt.errorSummary()` also writes the
 * class, `role="alert"` and `tabindex="-1"` on the box, and the component
 * leaves them alone. When the markup comes from a template without
 * JavaScript, the component fills in those three and the class on the
 * heading, and sets them back when a patch removes them. Either way, a box
 * without a name gets `aria-labelledby` pointing at its heading. The component
 * creates no nodes: it used to, and then the heading disappeared on the
 * first morph in Datastar and never came back.
 *
 * What is left are two things the browser does not do by itself:
 *
 * 1. Focus moves to the box when it becomes visible, so someone listening to
 *    the page learns that the submission stopped.
 * 2. Focus goes to the control itself when a link is followed. A plain anchor
 *    link only gives focus to a target that can take it; if it points to a
 *    label or a heading, `document.activeElement` becomes `<body>`, and the
 *    screen reader is not told where the user is. Tab continues from the
 *    target either way.
