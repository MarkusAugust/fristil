/**
 * That every fact `check-accessibility-tree.ts` builds on has one source.
 *
 * The tree check runs in a container for nearly two minutes, and much of
 * what it relies on is data copied between files: the texts a component
 * announces, the states the recorder listens for, the packages the container
 * installs, the Bun it runs, the step a known deviation applies to. A copy
 * that drifts does not fail there, it switches part of the check off: a
 * deviation for a step that does not exist is never consulted, and a state
 * the recorder does not listen for is "no event". This script reads the
 * sources and the places that must refer to them, without a browser.
 *
 * Run with: bun interfaces/scripts/check-accessibility-sources.ts
