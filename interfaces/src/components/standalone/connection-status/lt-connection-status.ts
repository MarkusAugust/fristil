 * Tells the user when the connection to the server is lost.

 * By definition the server cannot tell you this. When it is unreachable,
 * nothing comes from it. So this is a standalone component that creates all
 * of its content itself.
 *
 * It is not decoration in an app that fetches content from the server as it
 * goes. A page that loses its stream looks perfectly normal but is frozen,
 * and a user filling in a form over a dead connection loses everything.
 *
 * `navigator.onLine` only says whether the machine has a network, not whether
 * the server answers. That is why `reportFailure()` and `reportSuccess()`
 * exist: the app calls them when a request fails or succeeds.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const status = document.querySelector("lt-connection-status")
 * try {
 *   const response = await fetch("/api/save", { method: "POST", body })
 *   if (!response.ok) throw new Error(response.statusText)
 *   status.reportSuccess()
 * } catch {
 *   status.reportFailure()
 * }
