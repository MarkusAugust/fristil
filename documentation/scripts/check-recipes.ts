 * That the code in "How to use it" is actually right.
 *
 * Every component page opens with that section, and the tabs in it are what
 * the reader pastes in. A code block that looks right, but points at an entry
 * point that does not exist, or calls a builder function by another name, is
 * worse than no code: it looks authoritative and fails at the consumer.
 *
 * The check reads the mdx files as text and verifies every claim against what
 * the package actually ships:
 *
 *   - every `@lo-tek/interfaces/…` exists in `exports`;
 *   - every `defineLtX` is something that module actually exports;
 *   - every `lt.x()` is a builder function that exists;
 *   - every `lt-` class is in a stylesheet the package ships;
 *   - a package name appears only in tabs that have a build step, and a URL
 *     in those that do not.
 *
 * The last one is not pedantry. `import … from "@lo-tek/interfaces/dialog"`
 * in a `<script type="module">` does not resolve in a browser: without an
 * import map or a build step the package name does not exist. The tracks
 * "Plain HTML" and "Datastar" are defined by having no build step, so there
 * the address must be a URL.
