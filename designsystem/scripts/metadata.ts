/**
 * What an editor needs to know about each `<lt-*>` element: one sentence per

 *
 * The text here is the source of both `html-data.json` (VS Code) and
 * `web-types.json` (JetBrains) in the package. It is written by hand, but
 * TypeScript keeps it in step with the components: each element writes its
 * attributes as a `Record` over `observedAttributes`, so an attribute added
 * to a component without a sentence here, or a sentence about an attribute
 * that is gone, stops the type check. `check-vocabulary.ts` does the rest:
 * that every element the package registers is in the list.
 *
 * The file is not shipped in the package. Only `generate-vocabulary.ts` reads it.

/**
 * What each class takes as content, and the parts it consists of.
 *
 * The elements above say what the web components look for. The classes said
 * nothing: the manifest did not know that `lt-button` takes text, that
 * `lt-list` consists of `<li>`, or that `lt-table` has `<thead>` and `<tbody>`
 * with an `lt-table__sort` in a `<th>`. A tool that assembles markup from the
 * classes had to keep that in a list of its own.
 *
 * `content` uses the same vocabulary as the parts. `parts` is on the classes
 * with a fixed structure, and the selectors are relative to the element with
 * the class, as for the elements. A class that is only a part of another
 * component's markup, such as `lt-card__title` and `lt-table__sort`, points to
 * its parent with `partOf` instead of having parts of its own, and the parent
 * has a part that matches it.
 *
 * The table is kept in step with the package by `generate-vocabulary.ts`,
 * which stops on a class in the CSS that is missing here and on an entry
 * without a class, and by `check-vocabulary.ts`, which requires every
 * selector to match the markup on the component page, and `partOf` to point
 * to a class with a part that matches this one.
