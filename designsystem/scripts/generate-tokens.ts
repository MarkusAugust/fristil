 *

 * of them, so the 90 tokens are in one place.

 * nothing, and then `:root` and the media query apply again.
 *
 * It still needs `color-scheme`, which was found along the way. LO-TEK does
 * not set it on bare `:root`, since the package can be a guest on a page that
 * is not its own, so the advice has been for the consumer to write
 * `color-scheme: light dark` on `<html>` themselves. Done outside a layer,
 * that rule beats `@layer lotek`, and a chosen dark theme got light
 * scrollbars and form controls. Answering "put it in a layer before lotek" is
 * a trap: the layer order is already established by tokens.css, which loads
 * first, so a later `@layer` statement puts the layer behind. The control
 * therefore takes care of it itself, and whoever uses it does not need to
 * write `color-scheme` at all.
 *
 * The control wins over `data-theme` on the same element, since `:has()`
 * takes the specificity of its argument. That is on purpose: the server
 * sends the choice it has stored, and the click should take effect before
 * the response is back. The order is tested in all three engines in
