const TEMA = (oppskrift: Oppskrift) => `### Light and dark

Without you doing anything, the colours follow the device's setting. A page
that wants to decide for itself sets \`data-theme="light"\` or
\`data-theme="dark"\` on \`<html>\`.

The attribute is a **theme boundary** and works on any element, not only on
the root. One theme can sit inside another, both ways.

This is what an embedded component should use. When you put LO-TEK into a
page you do not control, set the attribute on the component's own root
element:

${temaEksempel(oppskrift)}

The component is then light whatever the device is set to, and the host is
left alone.

**The host's CSS stops at the boundary.** The host often has rules without a
layer, such as \`button { background: none; border: none }\` or a normalize,
and they beat \`@layer lotek\`. In that case, set \`data-lt-boundary\` on the
same root element:

${grenseEksempel(oppskrift)}

Below the root element the browser ignores CSS without a layer, within the
specificity below, and LO-TEK's layer applies again. The rule is in
\`lotek.css\` and in \`@lo-tek/interfaces/boundary.css\`. Fonts and other
inherited properties still come from the host, and the \`--lt-*\` variables
work. Three things follow from it:

- Your own CSS inside the boundary must be in a layer after \`lotek\`. CSS
  without a layer disappears there in the same way as the host's.
- Elements without a LO-TEK class lose the host's CSS without a layer. A layer
  the host has declared before \`lotek\`, such as Tailwind's Preflight in
  \`base\`, still applies where LO-TEK sets nothing.
- The boundary has the specificity (0,2,0). A rule from the host with the
  same specificity wins if it is loaded after the boundary, and one with more
  always wins. So do \`!important\` and layers the host has declared after
  \`lotek\`.

LO-TEK does **not** set \`color-scheme\` on \`:root\`. The property controls
the browser's own surfaces, that is, scrollbars, dropdowns and calendar
panels, and it is inherited. A child can opt out with \`color-scheme: normal\`,
but that is a counter-rule the host never asked to have to write: with the
value on the root, it applied to the whole document, including where the
package is only a guest. If the whole page should follow the system, write
\`color-scheme: light dark\` on \`<html>\` yourself, in the same way as you set
the layer order yourself. The exception is the theme picker below: when you
use it, each option sets \`color-scheme\` itself.

### Letting the user choose a theme

\`lt-theme-control\` on a radio button makes \`value\` a theme choice. It is
plain CSS, without a line of JavaScript:

${velgerEksempel(oppskrift)}

The choice controls two things. LO-TEK's colours come from the tokens, and
the browser's **own** surfaces from \`color-scheme\`: \`light\` gives \`light\`,
\`dark\` gives \`dark\`, and \`auto\` gives \`light dark\`. \`light dark\` is not
a theme, but the statement that the page works in both, so the browser can
choose by the system.

"Follow the system" has no theme block, and that is on purpose: a value
without a block matches nothing, and then the media query applies again.

Do not write \`color-scheme\` yourself when the picker is in use. Such a rule
outside a layer beats \`@layer lotek\` and locks the browser's surfaces to
the system while the user has chosen something else.

\`light\` and \`dark\` win over \`data-theme\` on \`<html>\`, so the server can
send the stored choice while a click still takes effect before the response
is back. \`auto\` does not: it means "no override from me", so if the server
has written \`data-theme\`, the server's value stands. For "follow the system"
to work at once, whatever stores the choice must also remove the attribute.

Two things it does not do. It **stores nothing**: submit the group in a form
and store the choice in a cookie the server reads, or in \`localStorage\`. And
it must be in the **same tree as \`<html>\`**, since \`:has()\` does not see out
of its own tree; a control inside a shadow root does not set the theme on the
page.`

const webComponents = (oppskrift: Oppskrift) => `## 4. Web components

Three rules apply to all of them:

1. ${oppskrift.registreringRegel} The import has no side effect on its own;
   it is the \`define\` call that registers the element.
2. **Boolean attributes are true as long as they are present.**
   \`hidden="false"\`, \`disabled="false"\` and \`open="false"\` turn it *on*.
   To turn any of them off, remove the attribute entirely.
3. **You write the markup, the component adds the behaviour.** \`<lt-field>\`
   does not create your label or your control. You write \`for\` on the label
   and \`id\` on the control, or wrap the control in a \`<label>\`, so the field
   has a name without JavaScript too. The component wires the help text and
   the error text with \`aria-describedby\` and \`aria-invalid\`, and never
   writes an id on the control: an id the server did not send makes an update
   from the server replace the field, with the focus and what the user has
   typed. The field is invalid when the error text is there without
   \`hidden\`.

    ekstra: `## 6. When the server sends new HTML

If you patch the page as it runs, with htmx, Turbo, Datastar or your own
\`innerHTML\` update, the question is what decides the state. By default the
web component does: \`<lt-tabs>\` remembers the tab the user selected, and puts
it back when a patch tears the selection away. The template needs nothing
for that.

This assumes the patch keeps the elements and only changes the attributes,
as a morph does: Datastar's \`outer\`, htmx with the idiomorph extension and
Turbo 8 with morphing. The selection is tied to the link itself. If the patch
replaces the nodes, as \`innerHTML\`, htmx's ordinary \`innerHTML\` and
\`outerHTML\` swaps and Turbo without morphing do, the tab is a different one,
and the component selects the one the URL points to, otherwise the one the
server hid the other panels for, otherwise the first. If the server wants to
decide, it writes \`hidden="until-found"\` on the other panels, or decides the
state alone with \`server-controlled\`.

A morph keeps an element only when the id matches: Datastar and idiomorph do
not morph an element with an id into one without, they replace it. The
components therefore never write an id on what the user touches: the field in
\`<lt-field>\` and \`<lt-suggestion>\`, and the tabs in \`<lt-tabs>\`. Write
\`for\` on the label and \`id\` on the field, or wrap the field in the label.
The tabs are links without an id, and the panels have the id the link points
to, the same on every render. The panel in \`<lt-popover>\` needs an id in the
same way, for \`aria-controls\` on the button; the component creates none. The
list and the options in \`<lt-suggestion>\` can be replaced; the component
wires them again and finds the highlighted option again by its text. The
component warns in the console the first time a patch replaces something the
user had touched.

If the server should be able to move the state, as in "go on to step 2", say
so with \`server-controlled\`. Then every patch decides, and the component
stops putting the user's choice back:

\`\`\`html
<lt-tabs server-controlled>
  <ul class="lt-tabs__list" aria-label="Parts of the case">
    <li><a href="#application">Application</a></li>
    <li><a href="#attachments">Attachments</a></li>
  </ul>
  <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="application">…</section>
  <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="attachments" hidden="until-found">…</section>
</lt-tabs>
\`\`\`

The attribute exists on \`<lt-tabs>\`, \`<lt-popover>\`, \`<lt-dialog>\` and
\`<lt-suggestion>\`. Without it the server and the component would fight over
the same state. Note that the state is always in the markup the server sent,
that is, \`aria-selected\` on the tab and \`hidden\` on the panel, not in an
attribute of its own.

## 7. The check is the only thing that reads your markup

\`\`\`bash
npx @lo-tek/interfaces check templates/*.html
\`\`\`

One finding gives an error code, so it belongs in CI next to the tests. It
catches \`lt-buton\`, \`data-variant="secundary"\`, \`<lt-modal>\` and
\`<lt-field>\` without a control or a label.

It is made for templates. Comments, \`<script>\` and \`<style>\` are skipped,
and \`<?…?>\` and \`<%…%>\` inside a tag do not end it early. These are
tested and give no false findings:

\`\`\`html
<button class="lt-button {{.Extra}}">Send</button>
<button class="lt-button" data-variant="{{.Variant}}">Send</button>
<span class="lt-badge" data-color="{% if x %}danger{% endif %}">1</span>
<button class="lt-button" data-variant="<?= $variant ?>">Send</button>
<button class="lt-button" data-variant="@variant">Send</button>
<button class="lt-button" data-variant="<%= variant %>">Send</button>
\`\`\`

${SJEKK_I_TESTER}

The check is also in the editor as you type. The VS Code extension "LO-TEK"
gives completion, explanations, error messages and quick fixes in sixteen
template languages. WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate read
\`web-types.json\` from the package without any extension, and the plugin
"LO-TEK" from JetBrains Marketplace adds the error messages and completion in
HTML in a string marked with \`@Language("HTML")\` or \`// language=HTML\`.

On the JVM without Node there is LO-TEK for Kotlin
(https://lo-tek.sobernetics.no/kotlin/). \`lotek.jar\` is the command line as

import "@lo-tek/interfaces/field.css"
\`\`\`

The name of each stylesheet is in the tables below. The package has no
dependencies, and nothing is registered by import alone, so a page that only
uses the CSS components takes no JavaScript from the package.

If you need everything in one file, there is
\`@lo-tek/interfaces/lotek.css\`, but with a bundler it is rarely right: you
then load CSS for components the page does not use.`,

defineLtField()
\`\`\`

The call is in the module, not in \`mounted\`, \`onMount\` or an effect. A hook
runs after the first paint, so the elements in the markup are plain
\`HTMLElement\`s when the framework renders them, and a call to \`show()\` or
\`reportFailure()\` before the hook fails with "is not a function".

The markup is ordinary HTML, in whatever template your framework uses:

\`\`\`html
<lt-field>
  <label class="lt-label" for="name" data-required="symbol">Full name</label>
  <input class="lt-input" id="name" type="text" name="name" required />
  <p class="lt-error-text" hidden>Enter your name.</p>
</lt-field>

<button class="lt-button" type="submit">Send</button>
\`\`\`

\`class\` and \`for\`, not \`className\` and \`htmlFor\`. It is React that
rewrites the attribute names, and that does not apply here.`,
    ekstra: `## 6. Typed builder functions

If the project has TypeScript, the classes can come from \`lt\` instead of
being written as strings. A variant that does not exist then becomes a
compile error:

\`\`\`ts
import { lt } from "@lo-tek/interfaces"

lt.button({ variant: "secondary" })
// { class: "lt-button", "data-variant": "secondary" }
\`\`\`

The builder functions return an object with HTML attribute names, which is
spread in where the template language supports spreading, or read out field
by field. The ${antallByggefunksjoner()} builder functions:

${byggefunksjoner()}

Where the template language cannot spread an object, \`lt.setAttributes()\`
sets the attributes on an element in plain DOM:

\`\`\`ts
const field = document.querySelector<HTMLInputElement>("#email")
const wiring = lt.field({ id: "email", error: true, invalid: true })

lt.setAttributes(field, lt.input({ type: "email" }), wiring.control)
\`\`\`

Call it again to change state. Three rules:

- **When the builder function has an option for an attribute, a call without
  the option removes the attribute.** So pass the options again every time.
  \`lt.spinner()\` without \`label\` removes \`role\` and \`aria-label\`.
- **What the builder function has no option for stays.** \`lt.button()\`
  does not touch \`disabled\` or \`type\`. \`id\` and \`for\` are never removed.
- **Two sets on the same element are passed separately**, as above. If they
  are spread together into one object, \`{ ...lt.input(), ...wiring.control }\`,
  the attributes are set, but only \`data-*\` is cleaned up on the next call.

## 7. Check the markup

\`\`\`bash
npx @lo-tek/interfaces check src/components/*.vue
\`\`\`

The check reads files as text, so it works on \`.vue\`, \`.svelte\`, \`.html\`
and whatever your templates happen to live in. One finding gives an error
code, so it belongs in CI. It catches \`lt-buton\`,
\`data-variant="secundary"\`, \`<lt-modal>\` and \`<lt-field>\` without a
control or a label, that is, everything the types do not see, because your
markup is a string to the compiler.

import { defineLt } from "@lo-tek/interfaces/register"

defineLt()
\`\`\`

The call is at the top of the module, not in a \`useEffect\`. An effect runs
after the first paint, so the elements are plain \`HTMLElement\`s when React
renders them, and a call to \`show()\` or \`reportFailure()\` before the effect
fails with "is not a function". The function does nothing on a server, so it
can sit in a root module that runs in both places. If you use only one
component, it has its own function, such as \`defineLtTabs()\` in
\`@lo-tek/interfaces/tabs\`.

\`\`\`ts
// src/lotek.d.ts, gives the web components types in JSX
import "@lo-tek/interfaces/react-jsx"
\`\`\`

A field is written with \`lt.field()\`. The wiring is then in the markup React
renders itself, on the server as in the browser. \`<lt-field>\` writes the
wiring on the elements before React hydrates, and with server rendering React
reports mismatches on the label, the field and the error text. Without a
server it works, but \`lt.field()\` is the way in both.

\`\`\`tsx
// ContactForm.tsx
import { lt } from "@lo-tek/interfaces/react"
import { useId, useState } from "react"

export function ContactForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [touched, setTouched] = useState(false)

  const invalid = touched && name.trim() === ""
  const field = lt.field({
    id: useId(),
    required: "symbol",
    error: true,
    invalid,
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>
      <label {...field.label}>Full name</label>
      <input
        {...lt.input({ type: "text" })}
        {...field.control}
        name="name"
        required
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        onBlur={() => setTouched(true)}
      />
      <p {...lt.errorText()} {...field.error}>Enter your name.</p>

      <button {...lt.button()} type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  )
}
\`\`\`

The id comes from \`useId()\`, so the server and the browser create the same
one.

\`lt\` is imported from \`@lo-tek/interfaces/react\`, never from the main
entry: the React entry gives \`className\` and \`htmlFor\`, the main entry
gives \`class\` and \`for\`. The ${antallByggefunksjoner()} builder functions
are in both:

${byggefunksjoner()}`,
    ekstra: `## 6. Only \`open={isOpen || undefined}\` works

This applies to every boolean attribute on a web component, such as \`open\`
on \`<lt-dialog>\` and \`<lt-popover>\`. React treats web components
differently between versions, and only this pattern is right in both:

| How it is written | React 18 (sets attribute) | React 19 (sets property) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`open=""\` | works | never open |
| \`open={isOpen}\` | always open | works |
| \`open={isOpen \\|\\| undefined}\` | works | works |

React 18 stringifies \`false\` to the attribute \`open="false"\`. The
attribute is then present, and so it is true. React 19 sets the property to
\`""\`, and the component reads the empty string as false.

If you import \`@lo-tek/interfaces/react-jsx\`, the first two forms become
compile errors.

The builder functions pass \`true\` or nothing, so
\`{...lt.dialog({ titleId, open: isOpen }).host}\` is already right.

## 7. The types

Without \`@lo-tek/interfaces/react-jsx\` TypeScript does not know
\`<lt-field>\` at all, and you get \`Property 'lt-field' does not exist on type
'JSX.IntrinsicElements'\`. With it you get autocompletion and errors on the
attributes:

\`\`\`tsx
<lt-field describedBy="terms" />         // error: the attribute is described-by
<lt-toast closeLabel="Close" />          // error: the attribute is close-label
<lt-connection-status offline="Down" />  // error: unknown attribute
\`\`\`

The types work by the package extending React's \`JSX.IntrinsicElements\`. If
the project has two installations of \`@types/react\`, which easily happens in
a monorepo, the package extends one while your code uses the other, and the
elements stay unknown. Run \`npm ls @types/react\` if something looks odd.`,

<p {...lt.helpText()} {...email.help}>We will send the receipt here.</p>
<p {...lt.errorText()} {...email.error}>Enter a valid address.</p>

## 7. Web components in Astro

component has to be registered. It wires the error text to the field when it
shows:

---
import "@lo-tek/interfaces/tokens.css"
import "@lo-tek/interfaces/field.css"
---

<lt-field>
  <label class="lt-label" for="name" data-required="symbol">Full name</label>

  <p class="lt-error-text" hidden>Enter your name.</p>
</lt-field>

<script>
  import { defineLtField } from "@lo-tek/interfaces/field"
  defineLtField()
</script>
\`\`\`

\`customElements\` exists only in the browser, so the registration cannot be
in the frontmatter. A \`<script>\` in the template is all it takes: the
components are ordinary web components, and need neither an Astro

\`data-signals\` creates the state, \`data-computed:invalid\` derives the
validation from it, \`data-bind:name\` binds the field both ways, and
\`data-on:blur\` records that the user has left it.

\`data-attr:hidden\` on the error text is the link to the component: it sets
\`hidden\` when the field is valid and removes it when it is invalid, and
\`<lt-field>\` counts the field as invalid when the error text is visible.
None of the React pitfalls exist here. Datastar works directly on the
attributes.`,
    ekstra: `## 6. HTML from the server

Datastar can let the server send HTML as the page runs, over Server-Sent
Events. A web component upgrades itself when it is inserted into the
document, as long as \`defineLtField()\` has run once. The server can
therefore send this as plain HTML:

\`\`\`html
<lt-field>
  <label class="lt-label" for="email" data-required="text">Email address</label>
  <input class="lt-input" id="email" type="email" value="alex@" />
  <p class="lt-help-text">We will send the receipt here.</p>
  <p class="lt-error-text">Enter a valid address.</p>
</lt-field>
\`\`\`

The component then sets \`lt-label\`, gives the help text and the error text
ids, adds \`aria-invalid\` because the error text is visible, and builds
\`aria-describedby\`, without any JavaScript being sent for this particular
field. That is the point of the \`frame\` components living in plain DOM: the
markup is the data, and the accessibility is wired where it lands.

If the server patches a component that holds state, the question is what
decides it. By default the web component does: \`<lt-tabs>\` remembers the
tab the user selected, and puts it back when a patch with \`outer\` tears it
away: \`outer\` morphs, and the selection is tied to the link itself.
\`inner\` and \`replace\` replace the nodes, and then the component selects the
tab the URL points to, otherwise the one the server hid the other panels for
with \`hidden="until-found"\`, otherwise the first. And \`outer\` morphs only
when the ids match: an element with an id the server did not send is
replaced. The components therefore never write an id on what the user
touches. The tabs are links without an id, and the panels have the id the
link points to, the same on every render, as \`lt.tabs()\` writes it. The
panel in \`<lt-popover>\` needs an id in the same way; the component creates
none. The control in \`<lt-field>\` and the field in \`<lt-suggestion>\` never
get an id from the component: the template writes \`for\` and \`id\`, which
HTML requires for the field to have a name without JavaScript, or the label
wraps the field and no id is needed. The component warns in the console the
first time a patch replaces something the user had touched. If the server
should be able to move the tab, say so with \`server-controlled\`:

\`\`\`html
<lt-tabs server-controlled data-on:tab-select="$tab = evt.detail.index">
  <ul class="lt-tabs__list" aria-label="Parts of the case">
    <li><a href="#application">Application</a></li>
    <li><a href="#attachments">Attachments</a></li>
  </ul>
  <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="application">…</section>
  <section class="lt-tabs__panel" id="attachments" hidden="until-found">…</section>

\`\`\`

The attribute exists on \`<lt-tabs>\`, \`<lt-popover>\`, \`<lt-dialog>\` and
\`<lt-suggestion>\`. Without it the server and the component would fight over
the same state.

\`lt\` can be used on the server or in a build step. Datastar does not need it
in the browser.`,
