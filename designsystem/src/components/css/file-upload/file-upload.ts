 * browser's own, and its text comes from the operating system's language. It
 * cannot be translated, so the label above the field must say what to upload.
 *
 * `accept` is a help in the file picker, not a barrier. The user can choose
 * "all files", so the type must be checked on the server anyway.
 *
 * ```ts
 * <input {...fileUpload({ multiple: true, accept: ".pdf" })} />
