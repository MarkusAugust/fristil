/**
 * The core: LO-TEK's check and theme generator, written in Rust and built to
 * a single WebAssembly module.
 *
 * The same module runs here, in VS Code, on the JVM (Chicory) and in
 * IntelliJ, and gives the same answer everywhere. The module has no imports,
 * so it needs no glue: the loader writes the text in as UTF-8 and reads the
 * answer out as JSON, as every host language does.
 *
 * The core carries no data. The vocabulary and the colour contract are given
 * to it with `loadManifest` and `loadContract`, from the files in the package.
 *
 * `diagnoseMarkup` and `diagnosePage` in `index.ts` load the module and the
 * files from the package themselves. `loadCore` is for anyone who has the
 * module some other way, such as an extension that bundles it, or a browser:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const core = loadCore(await WebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch(url)))
 * core.loadManifest(await (await fetch(manifestUrl)).text())
 * core.diagnosePage(html)
 * ```
 *
 * Synchronous, because Node, Bun and VS Code allow it. In the browser the
 * module must be compiled with `WebAssembly.compile` first, and the compiled
 * module passed here.
