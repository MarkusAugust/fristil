/**
 * Every sequence of server updates and user actions on a popover, to a
 * fixed depth, with the screen reader's view checked after each step.
 *
 * The scenario tests in `lt-popover.browser.test.ts` each follow one path: a
 * click, a patch, then a look. This one does not choose: the server can send
 * any of the versions below, by any of the ways an update arrives, and the
 * user can click, press the keys the component promises, move the focus,
 * and the app can call the methods, in any order. After every step the page
 * as the browser rendered it goes to the core, which computes the
 * accessibility tree from the specifications, and the invariants are
 * checked on that tree, on the wiring the component promises, on the top
 * layer, on the focus, on the position and on the events.
 *
 * Whether the panel must be open after a step is computed from what the
 * page promises, from the page as it stood before the step: the user's open
 * survives a morph, `open` from the server opens it, and under
 * `server-controlled` the server's `open` decides. The component's memory of
 * what the user asked for is part of the context, so the state search keeps
 * two paths apart that differ only there.
 *
 * The page is the recipe from the component page, with a button outside the
 * popover to click and focus. The component is the real one, and so are
 * Datastar and idiomorph.
