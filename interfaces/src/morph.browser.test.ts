/**
 * That a morph from the server does not strip what the web component has set.
 *
 * Datastar synchronises attributes like this, where `r` is in the page and `s`
 * is the server's node:
 *
 * ```js
 * for (let {name: l} of Array.from(r.attributes))
 *   !s.hasAttribute(l) && !o.includes(l) && r.removeAttribute(l)
 * ```
 *
 * `o` is the list from `data-preserve-attr`, and it is read from the server's
 * node. If a component sets an attribute that is not there, it disappears on
 * every patch. This test runs exactly that loop against real markup, after the
 * component has done its work, and requires the state to remain.
 *
 * The loop assumes the nodes are the same, and they are not always. Datastar
 * does not morph an element with an id into one without; it replaces it, and
 * that affects bare markup where the component created the ids itself. That is
 * tested against the real bundle in
 * `components/frame/tabs/lt-tabs-morph.browser.test.ts`.
