 * Every hover that changes the background must keep the contrast.
 *
 * This is the one class of bug the unit tests did not see. `.lt-button:hover`
 * read a token that does not exist, and the pagination's hover won on
 * specificity over `[aria-current="page"]`, so the page number the user was on
 * disappeared. In both cases the resting state was right, and every other
 * guard was green.
 *
 * The browser is the only honest judge here: which colour applies under the
 * mouse is decided by the cascade, and it was precisely the specificity that
 * went wrong. That is why the tests hover with the mouse rather than compute
 * from the stylesheet.
