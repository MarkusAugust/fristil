/**
 * That a link to every page gets an image when it is shared.
 *
 * Starlight writes the title, description and `twitter:card` itself, but no
 * image, and the front page sits outside Starlight and got none of them. A
 * link to the front page was shared on X as plain text. The image now comes
 * from `head` in `astro.config.mjs` and from `index.astro`, and a new page
 * under `src/pages/` falls outside just as easily as the front page did.
 *
 * The pages under `demo/` are exempt. They are shown in an `<iframe>` on the
 * pattern pages and are examples the reader copies, so sharing tags do not
 * belong in them.
 *
 * Run with: bun documentation/scripts/check-share-card.ts
 * Requires `documentation/dist` to be built.
